This repository contains [notes](https://github.com/mariocpinto/0008_MOOC_Getting_Started_with_Python/blob/master/Course_Notes.md) from the Coursera MOOC '[Getting Started With Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/info)'. This MOOC is the first of the four courses in the '[Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)'.

This repository is also intended to showcase my completion of this MOOC - My course records can be found [here](https://github.com/mariocpinto/0008_MOOC_Getting_Started_with_Python/blob/master/Course_Completion.md).
