Week 2 focuses on getting Python installed on your computer and validating this with a simple program.
It also introduces the 'Python Playground' application that can be used as a sanbox to test simple python programs
without the need for installing the software.

#### Week 3

Specifically, the following concepts are covered:
* Constants, variables and reserve words.
* Assignments & numeric statements.
* Operators: + - * / ** % - add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulus.
* Operator precedence: brackets > power > div/mult > add/subtract; Left to right for equal priority operations.
* Type and type conversion.
* Accepting string input using the ```input()``` function.
* Adding comments using the ```#``` sign.
* Choosing variable names wisely.

#### Week 5

Specifically, the following concepts are covered:
* Comparison operators: ```< <= == != >= >```.
* Indenting, de-indenting and nesting as a way of identifying code blocks.
* Conditional statement: One-way - ```if```; two-way - ```if else```; multi-way - ```if elif else```.
* The ```try``` / ```except``` structure.
Note that the except path is executed even when the try block has been partially executed before blowing up.
* Exiting code flow with ```quit()```.

#### Week 6

These are the topics covered in week 6:

* Indefinite loops with ```while```.
* Breaking out of a loop with ```break```.
