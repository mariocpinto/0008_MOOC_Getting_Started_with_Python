## Getting Started with Python: Course Notes

These notes are intended to be a high level overview / quick refresher of the contents of the Coursera course '[Getting Started With Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/info)'. This MOOC is the first of the four courses in the '[Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)'.

#### Week 1

These are the topics covered in week 1:

The content introduces the learner to the Python programming language and also explains the mechanics of the course. The 'Python for Informatics' book that this course follows can be found in html format [here](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/).

#### Week 2 

These are the topics covered in week 2:

Week 2 focuses on getting Python installed on your computer and validating this with a simple program.
It also introduces the 'Python Playground' application that can be used as a sanbox to test simple python programs
without the need for installing the software.

#### Week 3 

These are the topics covered in week 3:

A high level overview of the structure of a program is provided in this week. This week also includes a "Hello World" assignment.

#### Week 4

These are the topics covered in week 4:

Specifically, the following concepts are covered:
* Constants, variables and [reserve words](https://docs.python.org/2.5/ref/keywords.html).
* Assignments & numeric statements.
* Operators: + - * / ** % - add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulus.
* Operator precedence: brackets > power > div/mult > add/subtract; Left to right for equal priority operations.
* Type and type conversion.
* Accepting string input using the ```input()``` function.
* Adding comments using the ```#``` sign.
* Choosing variable names wisely.

#### Week 5

These are the topics covered in week 5:

Specifically, the following concepts are covered:
* Comparison operators: ```< <= == != >= >```.
* Indenting, de-indenting and nesting as a way of identifying code blocks.
* Conditional statement: One-way - ```if```; two-way - ```if else```; multi-way - ```if elif else```.
* The ```try``` / ```except``` structure.
Note that the except path is executed even when the try block has been partially executed before blowing up.
* Exiting code flow with ```quit()```.

#### Week 6

These are the topics covered in week 6:

Specifically, the following concepts are covered:
* Types of functions: built-in and user-defined.
* Defining functions with ```def```.
* Passing parameters to functions.
* Void and fruitful functions.
* Returning values from a function using the ```return``` keyword.

#### Week 7

These are the topics covered in week 7:

Specifically, the following concepts are covered:
* Indefinite loops with ```while```.
* Breaking out of a loop with ```break```.
* Finishing an iteration with ```Continue```.
* Definite loops with ```for``` and ```in```.
* Loop examples: finding max value, counting, summing, averaging, filtering, searching.
* The ```None```, ```is``` and ```is not``` keywords.

#### Concluding Remarks

This is a well-taught introductory course. The course instructor, Dr. Chuck is a very engaging teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course. If you have a background in programming in another language, it should be possible to go through this course pretty quickly.
